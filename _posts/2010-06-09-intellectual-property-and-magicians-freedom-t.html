<p>I don't often repost or link to other articles from this site. &nbsp;Generally, I'll just post a link to my Twitter stream and be done with it. &nbsp;But, I found this article on magicians and protection of their IP to be a really interesting read. &nbsp;So, I'd encourage you to check out the article entitled "Intellectual Property and Magicians" at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/intellectual-property-and-magicians">freedom-to-tinker.com</a>. &nbsp;It's a summary of the real source material in this SSRN&nbsp;<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1005564&amp;download=yes">draft paper</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Jacob Loshin. &nbsp;It's now 2010, and the article on magicians dates to at least as early as 2007. &nbsp;But it remains relevant and stimulating &nbsp;-- a great example of "long tail" web posts.</p>
