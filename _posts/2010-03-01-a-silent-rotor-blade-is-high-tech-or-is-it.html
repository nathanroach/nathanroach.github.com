    <p>This new helicopter blade is supposed to reduce the noise produced by the rotor, and the linked article has some interesting computer data to back it up. But, It looks very similar to the wing configuration of a hawk or other predatory bird.  Given that hawks and owls often dive their prey at high speed, reducing the noise produced by their approach increases their success rate.  </p><p>I'm not surprised that CFD shows that function follows a form that's existed in nature for years.</p></div>
