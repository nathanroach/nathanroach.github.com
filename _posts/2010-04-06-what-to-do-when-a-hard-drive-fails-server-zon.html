<p>The post linked above walks you through steps to recover data from a hard drive by repeatedly freezing it. &nbsp;I haven't tried it, nor do I plan to. The best option, of course, is to have a backup so you don't need to resort to extreme measures to recover your data.  Hard drives are cheap these days, and both Windows and Mac have built-in backup tools such as Time Machine.  They're cheap insurance to make sure you don't wind up needing to freeze hard drives or perform voodoo rituals to get your data back.</p>
<p>One thing drive makers don't tell you is that as drive sizes increase (and density per platter increases), the statistical probability of a single-bit error on any given volume increases.  So, as drives get bigger, the probability of failure increases unless additional steps (such as rigorous backup or error-correction) are taken.</p>
