<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><em>Avatar </em>isn't the first 3D film - or the first sci-fi film - to tackle issues of colonialism, and neither is it the first to feature CGI characters. If the set-up of the movie had been <em>that</em> original, not even Cameron could have got such lavish backing for it. The game-changer must be the <em>best</em>, not the newest. It must take familiar and popular elements to a new level. The previous two game-changers were not distinguished by their originality, but by their extraordinary invention and their capacity to place a new spin on what had gone before.</blockquote>

<p>I saw this gem in <a href="http://www.shadowlocked.com/index.php/component/content/article/41-feature/71-why-avatar-cant-join-star-wars-and-jurassic-park-as-a-game-changer#" title="a review" target="_blank">a review</a> of James Cameron's new movie Avatar. It's certainly not the first time I've read <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0618/154.html" title="variations" target="_blank">variations</a> on<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage" title=" this view" target="_blank"> this view</a> of commercially successful innovators.  But it bears repeating.  The first-mover advantage doesn't mean much if your implementation isn't great.  In fact, innovators face a tremendous challenge overcoming inertia.  That's why Hollywood sequels are such a mainstay of box office commercialism.  People know what they're getting and it doesn't require much cognitive effort from buyers to make the 'safe' choice.</p>
<p>So the lesson I take from these kind of examples is that you really need to focus on what your product does for the end-user, not necessarily what new technology is under the covers.  The really great products take a technology that is new (but not-quite-bleeding-edge) and combine it with a deep understanding of what problems it can solve for the viewer, user, or buyer.</p>
