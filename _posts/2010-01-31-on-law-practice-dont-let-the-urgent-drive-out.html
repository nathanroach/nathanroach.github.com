<div>I recently read an interview with Henry Kissinger and it reminded me of the practice of law. &nbsp;Former Secretary of State Kissinger was discussing the challenges that come with being Secretary of State or National Security Advisor. &nbsp;In talking about the decisions he made, he remarked -- "at the end of every day you almost have to make a decision - whom are you going to insult by not dealing with his or her problems?" &nbsp;While not all jobs are 24/7 triage, it's all too common a problem. &nbsp;According to Kissinger, "one of the problems of government is to separate the urgent from the important, and make sure you're dealing with the important and <b>don't let the urgent drive out the important</b>."</div><p /><div>That same comment could apply to running a law practice. For every client, their problem is the most important one - and from their perspective it should be. &nbsp;The tricky part is, of course, actually making it work. That's a management skill many people don't have but those that do tend to have the most successful firms and the happiest clients. &nbsp;Some people are able to do this instinctively, but I tend to believe that the really effective practitioners give it conscious thought and have developed a system that works within the unique constraints of their practice. &nbsp;How do you&nbsp;avoid letting the urgent drive out the important?</div>
