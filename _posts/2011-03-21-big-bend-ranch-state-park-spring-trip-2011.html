<p><strong>Outbound to Big Bend</strong></p>
<p />
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Living in San Antonio, I'm occasionally reminded that this part of Texas was once some pretty wild country. &nbsp;However, you'd have to be a student of history sometimes to tell. &nbsp;Thus, in the spirit of the old Westerns, &nbsp;when spring break rolled around this year, we decided to head off the beaten track.&nbsp;In homage to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_Gun%E2%80%93Will_Travel#Opening_sequence">Richard Boone</a>, in this case, it was "have Hummer, will travel".

<div>I've always wanted to get out to the Big Bend region, but it's still quite a drive from San Anton. &nbsp;Eight hours, in fact, which meant that I had to wait for a long weekend to make it viable. &nbsp;I found the time in March, over "spring break" and we spread out the drive over two days on the outbound trip. &nbsp;We departed San Antonio, in south central Texas on Friday night after work, finally getting wheels-up at about nine-o'-clock central time. &nbsp;</div>

<p />
<div>Having just completed a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hummernetworkforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=228408">22-hour uninterrupted round-trip</a>&nbsp;to Oklahoma earlier in the month, I was at least ready and prepped for the ride. &nbsp;Still, Texas by night isn't typically any great sight. &nbsp;We headed west out of San Antonio and the traveling party consisted of me, my wife, and my co-worker Travis in the H1. &nbsp;Following us in his Toyota was a long-time friend Kiff and his g/f Andrea. &nbsp;If I'd been thinking about it, we'd have snapped a quick departure pic, but the route map will have to suffice as visuals for now:</div>

<p />
<div><em>-- Day 1: Friday --</em></div>
<p />
<div><em>&nbsp;</em>Our first night's drive took us along HWY 90 through Uvalde, Bracketville, and Del Rio. &nbsp;There's an alternate route along IH10W that is probably quicker if you can move fast enough to take advantage of the freeway, but with a max cruising speed of about 65mph, the Hummer is no freeway queen. &nbsp;Although I've wrapped out the H1 to about 75mph before, that takes its toll on mileage, noise, and mechanical stress. &nbsp;Instead, we opted for the more scenic southern passage.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Lake Amistad</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Our plans for Friday night called for a stop-over at one of two parks at about the four-hour mark. &nbsp;Both Amistad Lake and Seminole Canyon are about half-way between San Antonio and Big Bend. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nps.gov/amis/index.htm">Amistad National Recreation Area</a>&nbsp;is maintained by the national park service, and occupies several exits off Hwy 90. &nbsp;It's well marked and you have the choice of a number of different campsites, most with water and even RV hookups.</div>

<p />
<div>Amistad is on the border of Mexico and the US, and offers boating, fishing, and good opportunities for photography. &nbsp;However, in passing by at night, we felt it was best to press on to Seminole to put as many miles as possible in Friday night.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Seminole Canyon</strong></div>
<p />
<div>We wound up staying the night at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/seminole_canyon/">Seminole Canyon State Park</a>&nbsp;in Val Verde County, TX. &nbsp;Like many Texas state parks, it was purchased from private owners and became a state park only recently, in the 1980s. &nbsp;Seminole canyon is known for its historic cave paintings, a result&nbsp;of settlement by humans as far back as 12,000 years ago. &nbsp;At that time, the climate was less arid than today's desert environment, and local wildlife included elephants, camel, bison, and horses. &nbsp;Eventually, the woodlands gave way to become more like today's grasslands and desert. &nbsp;During this time, early man memorialized their culture in more than 200 pictograph sites, containing rock paintings ranging from single paintings to caves containing panels of art hundreds of&nbsp;feet long.&nbsp;</div>

<p />
<div>On a more modern note, the park has showers and Wi-Fi internet access, which makes it a great stopover location. &nbsp;However, we were so tired the night before that we didn't bother to pitch tents or take advantage of the amenities. &nbsp;Rachel and I slept in the bed of the truck, and Travis threw down a cot on the first flat ground he could find. &nbsp;A night under the stars was nice, but at around 50 degrees, it was cold and windy!</div>

<p />
<div>We didn't get much in the way of photos at this location because we departed shortly after first light in the morning, in order to maximize our time in Big Bend. &nbsp;</div>

<div><em>-- Day 2: Entering Big Bend --</em></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Detouring via 170 and the Big Bend National Park</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Although the overview map earlier shows a route through Marfa, we opted to jog south through&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nps.gov/bibe/index.htm">Big Bend National Park</a>&nbsp;in order to take Hwy 170 along the Rio Grande. &nbsp;The National Park is a trip in and of itself, and a place I'd love to come back and spend some time in. &nbsp;In particular, the Black Gap road is supposed to be a great drive, and it can be done in most stock or nearly-stock trucks. &nbsp;However, since we had the Hummer, our course was set for the more rugged state park.</div>
<p />
<p />
</div>
</div>
<p><img src="/images/MVI_0087T.jpg" alt="Big Bend Ranch State Park - Spring Trip 2011" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>As you pass through the national park and traverse 170 along the Rio Grande, this route takes you along canyons, rolling hills, plains, and the river itself. &nbsp;It's a great drive and would be great fun in a sports car or roadster as well. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
</div>
</div>
<p><img src="/images/DSC_1554.jpg" alt="Big Bend Ranch State Park - Spring Trip 2011" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<div>We took the top off the Hummer and really enjoyed the scenery. &nbsp;The weather was perfect, warm and sunny but with the air just cool enough to make it pleasant. &nbsp;I wouldn't want to make the trip towards the summertime, but early spring really is the best time to travel in south texas.</div>
<p />
</div>

<div><strong>Big Bend Ranch State Park</strong></div>
<p />
<div>You wouldn't necessarily know it by the maps, but Big Bend Ranch is *really* remote. &nbsp;Your last opportunity to see paved road is when you turn off 170 and head north on "Bofecillos Rd". &nbsp;Here's the rig with the last of the pavement beneath.</div>
<p />
</div>
</div>
<p><img src="/images/DSC_1558.jpg" alt="Big Bend Ranch State Park - Spring Trip 2011" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Once you turn north towards the park, it's graded country road at best, and we averaged about 20-30 mph until reaching a fence with "no trespassing" signs. &nbsp;As we eventually figured out, the "road" passes through private land and while the road itself is public (I think), the land to either side is not.</div>
<p />
<div>{ More Photos and Video to come, showing entry to park}</div>
<p />
<div>As you reach the park itself, your only real indication that you're back on public land is the entry sign. &nbsp;The gravel roads continue to wind around and it takes about an hour to make it through to the Sauceda ranger station if you've never been before. &nbsp;We arrived after closing time on Saturday (I think they close around 4:30), so it took us pretty much a full day to make the drive from Seminole Canyon to the main ranger station at BBRSP. &nbsp;That meant that we were losing daylight if we wanted to make our first campsite by Dark. &nbsp;However, we returned to Sauceda later in the trip during business hours and a very enthusiastic ranger snapped a picture of us at the ranger station. &nbsp;He said he hadn't seen a Hummer out there before.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>The trail to Guale 2</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Guale 2 is considered one of the most scenic formal campsites out at the park. &nbsp;The trail is marked as "high clearance" and/or "4x4 high clearanc" and while it's not what I would consider technical, Kiff tried it in 2wd and had to switch on 4wd for at least some segments. &nbsp;It was a cakewalk in the Hummer, but rough enough that we spent most of it crawling along &nbsp; at between 10 and 20 mph. &nbsp;</div>

<p />
<div><strong>Guale 2 Arrival</strong></div>
<p />
<div>The Guale 2 site proved to be worth its billing as a highlight of the park. &nbsp;We set up camp on the flat, if rocky ground. &nbsp;There was a fire pit and !picnic table! in place at the site. &nbsp;I'm sure that was no fun at all to set up for whomever had to prepare the site initially.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>The view from the campsite makes the trek worthwhile. &nbsp;Although the temperatures had been up around 90 degrees during the day, they started to fall quickly as the sun went down and we tried to encamp quickly.</div>
</div>

<p />
<div><em>-- Day 3: Full Stay at Guale 2 --</em></div>
<p />
<div>Saturday went by in flash, and was consumed entirely by travel. &nbsp;Thankfully, our schedule had planned for a full day at Guale 2 on Sunday which allowed a more leisurely pace. &nbsp;We slept in, finally catching a full night's rest. &nbsp;I think "breakfast" wasn't ready until around 11am, but we enjoyed breakfast in style, with a dutch oven omlette made from scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, and green chile. &nbsp;The advantage to having an off-road capable trailer is that we could bring several coolers, and two were filled with dry ice to keep our perishables frozen or chilled for the duration of the trip.</div>

<p />
<p />
<div>The relaxed pace once encamped was nice. &nbsp;We set up a canopy over the picnic table and had a chance to do some day hiking. &nbsp;Travis, our resident shutter bug, is pictured here. &nbsp;In fact, any of the photos ending in "T" such as IMG_00XT.JPG are his work. &nbsp;Of course, I brought my camera too, so that the photographer could be photographed :)&nbsp;</div>

<div>We all set off to explore the local area on foot, and between the lot of us, most everyone was represented in photos. &nbsp;<img src="/images/DSC_1635.jpg" alt="Big Bend Ranch State Park - Spring Trip 2011" /></div>

<p />
<div>Rachel decided to show off and capture some pics for her dancers against the Guale 2 scenery. &nbsp;Since I can't do an arabesque (?) I just had to let the Hummer stand in for me.</div>

<div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>But, since getting the Hummer in position and taking photos is more than a one-man job, I had Rachel do a bit of driving as well and she got the truck positioned perfectly for some of its close-ups:</div>

<div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Slow and steady with the brakes !</div>
<p />
<div>We continued to do some exploring, and found some great rock formations. &nbsp;As time started to run short, we had to short-cut and do some rock climbing to get back to camp. &nbsp;</div>

<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>We had a pretty full afternoon, and returned to camp to prepare dinner. &nbsp;Steaks, baked potato, and burgers were all on the menu. &nbsp;However, we had to hurry when the sun started to set, because that's when Guale 2 really started to put on a color show. &nbsp;Travis had his photo rig ready.</div>

<div><em>-- Day 4: Breaking Camp and heading for the Backcountry --</em></div>
<p />
<div>As remote as the Guale 2 campsite is, that portion is still considered to be "maintained" camping. &nbsp;We also wanted to experience parts of the park that were classified as "unmaintained" backcountry. &nbsp;So, we broke camp on Monday and headed for the Chisos mountains in the northern part of the park. &nbsp;That required traveling back past the Sauceda station and into the backcountry. &nbsp;We inquired at the ranger station, and were told that even the rangers seldom go into that section of the park and one of them admitted that he'd never been more than a portion of the way in. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Undeterred, we headed out, using maps, GPS, and our best guesses as to where the trails lay.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
</div>
</div>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_0432T.jpg" alt="Big Bend Ranch State Park - Spring Trip 2011" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>After quite a bit of exploring and some false turns and dead-ends we finally wound up near a stream bed that showed some of the most vibrant greens we'd seen the whole trip. &nbsp;</div>
<p />

<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Daylight was again running out, and while I wasn't thrilled with making camp in the lowlands, we found the most suitable place possible. &nbsp;We continued watching the "Lonesome Dove" series that we started the previous evening, and enjoyed some pre-St. Patty's day corned beef stew.</div>

<div>With the technology these days, even "roughing it" doesn't have to be quite so rough. &nbsp;What's not to like about watching Westerns under a clear western sky?</div>
<p />
<div><em>-- Day 5: The Long Retun --</em></div>
<p />
<div>Even with the time we had, it felt like we barely scratched the surface of what Big Bend has to offer. &nbsp;Between the state and national parks, you could spend years exploring and not see it all. &nbsp;Tuesday was a travel day, and we had to use all our available time to make it home.</div>
<p />
</div>
</div>
<p><img src="/images/DSC_1699.jpg" alt="Big Bend Ranch State Park - Spring Trip 2011" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Once we broke camp and reached the main road, Kiff and Andrea headed north. &nbsp;The crew in the Hummer headed back south, giving up two hours but gaining the benefit of following 170 again along the Rio Grande. &nbsp;We stopped off at the Contrabando movie set, a pseudo-villa built along the banks of the river by the movie industry for filming westerns.</div>

<div>It's a popular tourist stop, and a good place to eat a picnic lunch to break up the drive. Although not authentic, it's worth a stop just for fun.</div>

<div>Once you set off from the Contrabando set, it's back up through the National Park and then a good haul back along 90 to San Anton. &nbsp;Because we were doing this leg during the day, we got to enjoy the Pecos River Gorge. &nbsp;If we'd had time to stop, I would have liked to get out and take some photos of my own there. &nbsp;</div>
