<p>I came across this article published at the American Mathematical Society as part of my morning reading:</p>

<p>It's a really interesting discussion of how various geometric formulae are used to enable the characters to move in a natural way.  I think exposing this kind of real-world application of relatively easy-to-understand concepts is a great way for educators to show their students how seemingly austere concepts can be made to do "fun" things that apply to their own lives. </p>
<p>The animation shops that lead their field today draw upon the talents of artists, mathematicians, programmers, and many other disciplines to tell a compelling story.  The viewer gets to look through the mind's eye of the storyteller, but only because countless professionals have plied their trade to make it all work seamlessly.</p>
<p>So, next time you wonder that "tan" or "cos" key on your calculator is for, just think of talking mice ...</p>
