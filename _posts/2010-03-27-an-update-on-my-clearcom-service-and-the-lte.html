<p>I <a href="http://nathanroach.com/im-trying-clearcom-clearwire-4g-wimax-interne">wrote about Clear</a> when it was first launched in San Antonio. &nbsp;The TLDR version of that article is that I had mixed feelings about the service from a business perspective, but felt that the technology was promising. &nbsp;I've been using Clear's service now for almost four months, and <a href="http://nathanroach.com/im-trying-clearcom-clearwire-4g-wimax-interne">that article</a> has gotten some decent traffic and <a href="http://everydaysimplicity.blogspot.com/2010/03/clear-wireless-4g-internet-service-is.html" target="_blank">cross-links</a>, so another update is due. &nbsp;Here are the big changes since I last looked at them:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pricing "for life" pitch is gone.</span></p>
<p><span><span>This was probably just a promo deal, but when the service launched, you could get mobile for $30/mo and home+mobile for about 50-60/mo "for life". The home+mobile is really just two lines of service. &nbsp;There's no reason you couldn't have both lines acting as mobile. The current two-line plan adds a teaser rate, but drops the guaranteed pricing: "Pay only $30/month for the 1st two months, then $55/month thereafter." The single-line plan is even cheaper up front but winds up being more expensive long-term: "Pay only $15/month for the 1st two months, then $40/month thereafter."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>They may be capping speeds.</span></span></p>
<p>It also looks like there *might* be speed caps now. &nbsp;The old plan offered unlimited download <em>speeds, </em>which I read as meaning that the actual download speed of your connection was limited only by the WiMAX protocol's limits and that bandwidth that's provisioned to the towers.</p>
<p>The new mobile plan advertises "unlimited internet usage" and "download speeds up to 6.0 Mbps". &nbsp;In reality, I never saw more than 6 megs down on the unlimited plan, but there is a difference between unlimited usage with a "speed limit" of 6.0 Mbps and uncapped, unlimited usage. &nbsp;I can't tell if this was actually implemented as a technological "hard cap" or whether it's just a more accurate re-wording of their legalese. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You can get contract-free pricing if you're careful.</span></p>
<p>Once you get to the sign-up link, you can choose a 2-year Agreement or Month-to-Month. &nbsp;<strong>DO NOT CHOOSE THE AGREEMENT.</strong>&nbsp;The only benefit to the agreement is that you can add the equipment as a monthly leased expense. WIth month-to-month you have to pay for the equipment up front. &nbsp;Still, the cost of leasing equipment almost never works out in the customer's favor. &nbsp;Ever since the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~cyberlaw/FCCOps/1968/13F2-420.html">Carterfone</a> decision, operators have been prohibited from requiring only their own&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;on telephone networks, and while I don't know if Clear's internet-only offering would be covered, it's a safe bet that you should pick up your own gear if you can. After all, y<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060915/162903.shtml">ou don't want to wind up paying $4,900 for use of rotary phone, do you?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, you can <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p3907.m38.l1313&amp;_nkw=clear+usb+modem&amp;_sacat=See-All-Categories" target="_blank">get 4G USB adapters on Ebay</a> for $10-$15. &nbsp;Why pay monthly for cheap hardware?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You can get Clear service from your Cable Co.</span></p>
<p>Clear has agreements with Sprint, Time Warner, and Comcast. &nbsp;These guys are just <a href="http://www.phonenews.com/time-warner-to-resell-wimax-as-road-runner-mobile-on-december-1st-9269/">re-branding the Clear service</a>, and selling it at a markup. &nbsp;Time Warner calls theirs "<a href="http://text.broadbandreports.com/shownews/Time-Warner-Cable-Launches-Roadrunner-Mobile-105765">Road Runner Mobile</a>". I know Sprint holds an interest in Clear, and it's possible that TW and Comcast do as well. &nbsp;Unless you prefer the convenience of consolidated billing, or just love cable company customer service, you can probably save some money buying directly from Clear.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LTE is coming, 4G+ is here.</span></p>
<p>With technology, there's always the "next greatest thing" right around the corner. &nbsp;Heck, WiMAX deployments are still relatively cutting edge. &nbsp;AT&amp;T is still pushing 3G on the iPhones and iPad. (article on this to follow). &nbsp;But, LTE is another kind of 4G technology that could offer a 2x to 10x improvement over WiMAX, depending upon how the carriers deploy it. &nbsp;Verizon is pre-announcing&nbsp;LTE gear already.</p>
<p>And, Clear has implemented plans they're calling 4G+ that can fall back to 3G (on Sprint's EVDO network), but with limitations on speed and total transfer. &nbsp;There's probably enough for a separate post just on LTE and WiMAX, and&nbsp;Clear has made some public statements about possibly moving to LTE when it's more broadly available. &nbsp;So, this could get interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Would I recommend it?</span></p>
<p>Clear's service isn't flawless. &nbsp;But it's good enough that I've switched to it full-time at home and keep a mobile USB adapter in my laptop bag. &nbsp;I just called Time Warner and scheduled a disconnect. &nbsp;Between free over-the-air HDTV and Clear's wireless internet, I can cut the cord. &nbsp;If you're a speed junkie, you'll still get faster speeds on a wired cable modem. &nbsp;If you use VOIP extensively and aren't in a strong coverage area, calls on Clear's network can be choppy.</p>
<p>I'm happy enough with it to run Clear as my only ISP. &nbsp;But I'm also tolerant of bleeding-edge technology glitches and can troubleshoot most problems myself. &nbsp;I think Clear is mostly there in terms of being ready for mainstream adoption. &nbsp;As long as they can keep enough bandwidth to the towers and they don't over-subscribe users, I think they'll be fine.</p>
