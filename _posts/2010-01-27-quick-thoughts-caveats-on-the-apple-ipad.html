<p>There's going to be a lot of buzz surrounding the new Apple iPad announced by Steve Jobs today. &nbsp;I won't rehash all the news that's already on the blogosphere, but I did want to point out a few caveats:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get the 3G model if you want location serv</strong><strong>ices</strong>. &nbsp;Yes, it'll cost at least $629 instead of $499 for the base model. &nbsp;But you need the 3G SIM card to get GPS. &nbsp;Otherwise, you get the same wifi-based location services that the 2G iPhone used. &nbsp;Given how many apps these days are location-aware, the extra money is worth it to have the GPS hardware on-board. &nbsp;Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see an announcement this summer for an iPhone 4G and a iPad 4G. &nbsp;Assuming AT&amp;T can handle the data demand.</li>
<li><strong>Apple crippled the video-out. &nbsp;</strong>It will play HD 720p video on the internal screen. &nbsp;But the video out port is analog-only. &nbsp;Which means VGA to a computer or Standard Def 576p to a TV. Blech. &nbsp;Maybe an AppleTV refresh is coming based on this thing's video engine, but the iPad isn't an HDTV convergence device yet.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>They could have called it the iPod Touch DX</strong> instead of iPad. &nbsp;Steve Jobs may call it "magical", but its not revolutionary.</li>
<li>The iBooks app looks a whole lot like Delicious Library. &nbsp;And it's recycling a name from Apple's consumer portable. &nbsp;I wonder how many of these are going to be sold on ebay by mistake.</li>
<li>It ships in 60 days. &nbsp;Good luck getting one. &nbsp;While I'm not blown away, I'll be in line for one anyway. It looks useful as a color Kindle or upscaled iPod.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
