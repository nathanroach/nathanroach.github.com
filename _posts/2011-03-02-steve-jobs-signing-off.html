<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #828282; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Apple introduced the iPad 2 today. &nbsp;By itself, the faster processor and camera additions aren't significant changes. &nbsp;In all, it was an evolutionary product release. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p />
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #828282; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: #000000;">But a couple of slides near the end were a Titanic shift from prior product releases. For example, the technology/liberal arts slide he used.</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">Is this Steve Jobs signing off?</span></div>

<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Looking at Engadget's coverage, the tone of Steve's closing seems very different from any past event I can recall. It's always about Apple and about the Product. Jobs is very focused and doesn't "accidentally" include information in his presentations that isn't deliberate.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Why then would he include that slide depicting the intersection of technology and liberal arts? Why bother using a product launch to make a mission statement: "This is worth repeating. It's in Apple's DNA that technology is not enough. It's tech married with the liberal arts and the humanities. Nowhere is that more true than in the post-PC products. Our competitors are looking at this like it's the next PC market. That is not the right approach to this. These are post-PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC, more intuitive." [edit: he used the same slide in the iPad launch, but its re-inclusion here was accompanied by comments that seem to be of a different tone.]</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">His statements don't sound like a product pitch to me. It sounds like a going-away message to Apple's employees. It's a public reminder of what Apple stands for, even without Jobs at the helm.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Jobs also highlighted the scope of apple beyond the stage presenters: "I'd like the teams that worked on this to stand up -- give them a round of applause. And as always, I'd like to thank everyone's families. They support us and let us do what we need to do. They make it possible for us to work our tails off."</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Perhaps I'm reading more into this than necessary, but this change in tone appears to be significant. It's the first steps to mapping out a post-Jobs Apple. A public recognition that the success or failure doesn't hinge upon one man's presence, but instead the atmosphere and culture that was developed under his tenure.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Verdana; color: #828282; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I'd like to be wrong, but this may be one of the last times we see Steve Jobs take the stage, and I think he knows it.</span></p>
