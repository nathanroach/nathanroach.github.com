      <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">This shows the number of swearwords used per 1000 commits. Objective C and Perl

The analysis covered C, C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Objective-C, Perl, Python, and Ruby, among others.  The results were interesting and produced both useful and entertaining correlations.</p></div>
