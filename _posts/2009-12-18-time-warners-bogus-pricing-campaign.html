<p>Basically,&nbsp;[Time Warner]&nbsp;is&nbsp;saying they face increasing contract prices when it comes time to renewing their content deals, and they&rsquo;re telling me, their customer, that they may have to raise prices on my service if I want to keep getting the same programming that I&rsquo;ve gotten before. In essence, they&rsquo;re trying to say that it&rsquo;s not their fault that prices will be going up &mdash; it&rsquo;s those evil content providers who are fleecing the innocent Time Warner. And if they do raise prices, it&rsquo;ll be my fault as a customer &mdash; I should have supported them when I wanted them to get tough.</p>
<p>What a complete crock.</p>

<p>I was going to write a post on my thoughts about Time Warner's new price hike campaign, but then I ran across this post by Mike Schramm that says everything I wanted to say.  <a href="http://www.mikeschramm.com/general/roll-over-or-roll-over-20091208" title="So take a look." target="_blank">So take a look.</a></p>
