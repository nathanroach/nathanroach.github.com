<p>I was recently asked to speak at a CLE on the topic of ESI Discovery for the third-annual&nbsp; <a href="https://m360.sabar.org/ViewEvent.aspx?id=8664&amp;instance=0" title="Bench Motions and Trials CLE" target="_blank">Bench Motions and Trial CLE</a> on May 20, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really enjoyed working with the Judges on the materials and we wound up with more material than we could fit into the time allotted. The following are some slides that I prepared on Managing Electronically Stored Information (ESI) in legal discovery.&nbsp; The speakers for this presentation were Judge Richard Price, Judge Cathy Stryker, and attorney Nathan Roach.&nbsp; We covered most of the material on the slides, and I've attached both interactive quicktime and static PDF versions below.&nbsp; This information is being shared at a private URL, so please only share this link with other attendees (or email me for permission to redistribute).</p>
