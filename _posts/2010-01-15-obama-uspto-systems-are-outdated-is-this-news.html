While I'm not the least bit surprised by this admission, I have to think that at least certain aspects (electronic -&gt; print -&gt; scan) do seem ripe for automation.  Even if you'd need to take all the examiners offline while implementing the system, the net gain in time seems like it would offset the lost of productivity during the transition.  The trick is to find a way to budget for overhauls such that long term gains aren't hamstrung by a large up front capex.  Some things just can't be done gradually.
