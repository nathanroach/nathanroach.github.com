<div>Now <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/13/valleywag-offers-questionably-legal-100000-apple-tablet-bounty/">this is interesting.</a> <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/5447390/announcing-valleywags-apple-tablet-scavenger-hunt-win-up-to-100000">Valleywag</a> announced that it is offering a bounty of up to $100,000 for information on the Apple tablet/iSlate/iTablet/ReallyBigiPhone  device.</div>

<div>TechCrunch (and others) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011303072.html">pointed out</a> that doing so might expose them to a tortious interference claim.  It's certainly a colorable argument, and it wouldn't be the first time that a big company <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arizona/azdce/2:2006cv02555/322017/10/">bullied</a> a smaller one with that <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arizona/azdce/2:2006cv02555/322017/10/">cause of action</a>.  It should be interesting to see how it plays out if Valleywag has any success with its campaign.</div>
<p>Update: &nbsp;Well the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5448255/">cease-and-desist letter </a>didn't take long.&nbsp;</p>
