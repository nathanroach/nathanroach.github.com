    <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to try Clear.com's 4G WiMax service.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Managing Expectations</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong></strong></span><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Current Alternatives:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I live in an area with pretty basic Internet access. &nbsp;Time Warner Cable supplies cable internet with a burst speed of 20mbps down and 2 up. &nbsp;I usually get 10-15 sustained down and I'm lucky to see 1 up. &nbsp;AT&amp;T offers its U-Verse product in our city, but haven't built it out to our older neighborhood yet, so the only option from them is DSL. &nbsp;Both AT&amp;T and Time Warner have absolutely frightening 2-year contracts, although Time Warner calls theirs a "</span><a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/centraltx/learn/bundles/plgterms.html" title="price lock guarantee" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">price lock guarantee</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">" instead of a contract. &nbsp;They should call it a "customer lock extortion" instead. &nbsp;I've been with them on a month-to-month plan for some time and my bill fluctuates monthly with a general upward trend. &nbsp;I've desperately wanted to decouple my TV and Internet because Time Warner has this clever policy where they give you a "discount" on your internet for having TV service. &nbsp;Which means that if you just want to buy an internet line, it costs you just as much as buying internet and TV together.</span></span></em></span></span></p>
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Some Concerns on Clear's Terms of Service:&nbsp;</em><span style="font-size: medium;">When I heard about Clear.com building out </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX" title="WiMAX" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">WiMax</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> in my area, I was ecstatic. I'm under no illusions that Clear (previously Clearwire) is some kind of savior or game-changer. &nbsp;They're </span><a href="http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_newsroom&amp;ID=1141088" title="largely owned by Sprint" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">largely owned by Sprint</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">, a company that has </span><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10004328-38.html" title="been found" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">been found</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> to enforce unconscionable contracts on its customers. &nbsp;My own history with them validates that finding, although I haven't monitored the case to see if/how the appellate process turned out. &nbsp;However, given the number of home visits I've required from Time Warner just to get basic things like cable-card support working I was ready to try out someone new. &nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The User Experience</span></strong></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Give it a Go, Quickly:&nbsp;</span></em><span style="font-size: medium;">Clear doesn't give you a very broad window to decide if the service is to your liking. &nbsp;I think you get five or seven days before you're bound (like the others) into a two-year contract. &nbsp;They also do some sneaky things like requiring you agree to a TOS which states you agree to their ETF, but then you have to call them to actually find out the ETF (which also makes it hard to </span></span><a href="http://www.tzlegal.com/clearwire.asp" title="prove in court" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">prove in court</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> if they </span><a href="http://clearwiresucks.com/blog/2009/04/22/lawsuit-filed-against-clearwire/" title="try to screw you later" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">try to screw you later</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">). &nbsp;I did call customer service before signing up, and the rep was very friendly but lied to me directly claiming that I could "save big money" signing up through him rather than the web site. &nbsp;He said it would take weeks to receive my equipment from the web site and that I'd have to pay for shipping. &nbsp;Neither of which was true.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Fast Shipping, (mostly) Fast Internet:&nbsp;</span></em></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite the rep's (commissioned?) pleas to sign up by phone, I placed my order through the web site. &nbsp;&nbsp;I signed up via their web site Monday afternoon and had the equipment at my door the very next day. &nbsp;The equipment was well boxed and already provisioned so setup was literally a plug-and-go affair. &nbsp;I chose the bundle of home, mobile, and voice.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Image credit: </span><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/testing-clears-wimax-internet-service/" title="Digital Trends" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Digital Trends</span></a></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><img src="http://static.digitaltrends.com/images/features/testing-clears-wimax-internet-service/2.jpg" align="left" alt="" /><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;The broadband modem for home use required two plugs, one for ethernet and one for power. &nbsp;Within 2 minutes I had a signal and was connected to the internet via my router. &nbsp;My average latency was 120ms, up from about 40ms on cable. &nbsp;Download speed ranged widely from about 3mbs to 7mbs. &nbsp;Upload was even less than cable, delivering 400kbps vs 800kbps previously. &nbsp;In actual usage though, the speed differences weren't obtrusive. &nbsp;Unlike 3G via my iPhone, the WiMax 4G felt like wired internet. &nbsp;I was even able to get in a bit of MMORPG gaming and the lag was tolerable, delivering about 200ms in-game. &nbsp;While this objectively this seems like a lot more than the 70ms I saw on cable, it didn't feel that way. &nbsp;Not to mention I've seen lag-storms of 2500ms+ on roadrunner in the past (based on my neighbors' usage?). &nbsp;</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;">The mobile installation is almost as easy. &nbsp;In the box is the USB receiver, an elbow adapter, and a USB drive with the connection manager software. &nbsp;Well, the software for PC that is. &nbsp;For my Macbook Pro, I needed to visit their site and download the connection manager. &nbsp;Fortunately, it was an easy install and the software explicitly lists compatibility with Snow Leopard. &nbsp;Installation didn't require a reboot and I was quickly in business.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;">Overall, the speeds aren't going to blow you away if compared to wired internet, but they are very reasonable. &nbsp;And for the price, I'd say it's quite a deal. &nbsp;$70 a month covers me for home, mobile, and VOIP. &nbsp;That's less than I was paying for home service alone from the cable company. &nbsp;I lose out on a little bit of speed, but that seems a reasonable trade-off for the flexibility and superior mobile speed.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Edit:</span></em><span style="font-size: medium;"> I found a review from </span></span><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/testing-clears-wimax-internet-service/" title="Digital Trends" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: medium;">Digital Trends</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> that goes into a bit more detail on the user experience, and my observations are consistent with their findings.</span></span></div>
